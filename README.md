# Medieval hero's agency

It's a simple and fun game made in old-school style.

**NOTE**: currently, this repo contains just a description of a pet-project which will be left unfinished forever like many others (hope, not).

I'd appreciate any help, because it's hard to find enough time and energy to work on it on my own.

## Overview

As a player, you manage medieval hero's agency: you can hire heroes, dismiss, send them to complete different missions. Each completed mission gives you money and fame. You can spend money on new heroes, upgrades, trainings, buying stuff for your agency. Important: heroes can die, no resurrections, no save/load hacks.
Game lasts till you defeat the Evil Dragon.
